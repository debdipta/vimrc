			<strong><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">DNS load balancing</span></strong></h1>
		<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
			<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">DNS load balancing is all about the practice of configuring a domain in the Domain Name System (DNS) such that client requests to the domain are distributed across a group of server machines. A domain can correspond to a website, a mail system, a print server, or any other service that is made accessible via the Internet.<br style="box-sizing: border-box;" />
			DNS serves as the &ldquo;phone book&rdquo; for the Internet: it maps domain names like www.google.com, which are the similar of personal or business names in the phone book, to Internet Protocol (IP) addresses like 172.16.205.3, which are the similar of phone numbers. Every device that sends or receives data on the Internet has a unique IP address, which the Internet&rsquo;s routing software and hardware use to identify and locate the device. DNS is what makes it possible for users to access a website by name, which is easier for most people to remember than the string of numbers in an IP address.<br style="box-sizing: border-box;" />
			In the simplest deployment, a single computer hosts and serves the data for a domain; when a client requests resolution of the domain name, DNS returns the single server&rsquo;s IP address. Today many domains use multiple server machines &ndash; to protect against server failure or handle high traffic volume, among other reasons &ndash; and in this case DNS returns a list of all the servers&rsquo; IP addresses in response to a name resolution request.</span></span></p>

			<strong><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">How DNS Load Balancing Works</span></strong></h2>
		<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
			<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">DNS load balancing relies on the fact that most clients use the first IP address they receive for a domain. In most Linux distributions, DNS by default sends the list of IP addresses in a different order each time it responds to a new client, using the round-robin method. As a result, different clients direct their requests to different servers, effectively distributing the load across the server group.<br style="box-sizing: border-box;" />
			Unfortunately, this simple implementation of DNS load balancing has inherent problems that limit its reliability and efficiency. Most significantly, DNS does not check for server or network outages or errors, and so always returns the same set of IP addresses for a domain even if servers are down or inaccessible.<br style="box-sizing: border-box;" />
			Another issue arises because resolved addresses are usually cached, by both intermediate DNS servers (called resolvers) and clients, to improve performance and reduce the amount of DNS traffic on the network. Each resolved address is assigned a validity lifetime (called its time-to-live, or TTL), but long lifetimes mean that clients might not learn about changes to the group of servers in a timely fashion, and short lifetimes improve accuracy but lead to the increased processing and DNS traffic that caching is meant to mitigate in the first place.</span></span></p>

			<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">If your application is your business, you need to keep it accessible 24/7, if possible, almost without any interruption. Unfortunately, scaling horizontally over many servers at one location is not always the solution because of unexpected data-centre problems.<br style="box-sizing: border-box;" />
			Globally-distributing your virtual servers across different geographical centres, however, can provide you the stability you require -- thus, keeping applications&#39; up-time level as high as possible.<br style="box-sizing: border-box;" />
			In terms of IT system-design, this kind of structure is referred to as high-availability.</span></span></p>

			<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">Simply put, highly available application deployment structure, as we have just covered, depends on delivery and response to clients from different datacentres.<br style="box-sizing: border-box;" />
			Although there are a number of possible ways to obtain this kind of structure, probably the simplest and the most affordable one is to take advantage of how DNS works.<br style="box-sizing: border-box;" />
			A basic example set up can be considered as the following:<br style="box-sizing: border-box;" />

			<strong><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">How To Achieve High-Availability Using DNS</span></strong></h2>
		<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
			<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">When a user types the domain name of a website, through a set of defined rules (i.e. a protocol), the web-browser dials name-servers and asks them the address of the machines hosting the said web-site. Once it receives the IP address, then it sends the request to that computer, along with some additional data, and renders the response.<br style="box-sizing: border-box;" />
			Since DNS allow multiple records to be kept (even the same kind), it becomes possible to list multiple hosts as the server.<br style="box-sizing: border-box;" />
			Therefore, as demonstrated on the above schema, if you list the IP address of 2 load-balancers / reverse-proxies, located at two different locations, each set to balance the load between application servers, again located at at least two different data-centres, if one of the data-centres becomes unreachable, the client&#39;s web-browser will try the next IP address records returned by the DNS server and repeat the process to get the web-site.<br style="box-sizing: border-box;" />
			This kind of load-balancing is called Round Robin DNS load-balancing.</span></span></p>
